            <h4 style="text-decoration: underline;">2017</h4>

            <h5 style="text-decoration: underline;">October</h5>
            <p>23 October 2017: Release 1.8.6 (it was about time!). Changed actions order (now: Add, Delete, Move) Redmine Task#206. Updated copyright.
            Made "add/remove children" action more intelligent (if all children are neither optional nor multiple, then there is no point 
            in showing the cog icon at all)</p>
            <p>12 October 2017: Thesaurus functionality fine tuning.</p>
            <p>11 October 2017: Hierarchical view for thesaurus fields fully functional!</p>
            <p>10 October 2017: Added new type of field (Thesaurus). Combo is functional. Needs extra work to show hierarchy properly.</p>

            <h5 style="text-decoration: underline;">September</h5>
            <p>11 September 2017: Bug fixes (undefined and mode mayhem). Fixed "maximun" instead of "maximum" typo.</p>

            <h5 style="text-decoration: underline;">August</h5>
            <p>31 August 2017: Fixed a bug when changing node visibility. Also fixed a bug when cloning a node with recursive path (showed undefined instead
                of node label)</p>
            <p>29 August 2017: Fixed an issue with ValidActionsFilter (added editAdmin)</p>
            <p>24 August 2017: Started keeping diary. Clicking on 'e' (FeXML) opens it.</p>
